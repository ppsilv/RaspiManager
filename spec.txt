I have 4 raspberry PIs with linux ubuntu installed on them, they were for building a cluster but I never did it and the cpus was left over for other projects.
One of them I call raspi003, I put an IOTStack with Mediawiki, Nextcloud, MariaDB, PHPmyadmin, Wireguard, Mosquitto and Portainer to orchestrate all this.
Another one is called raspi002 and in it I have a system that is checking all the time if the other raspberrys are running and if the internet is up.
One of them mysteriously stopped working, I've already checked all the voltages on the power supply and they are as the electrical schematic says they should be so I considered a drop in my equipment.
The 4th is currently underutilized, doing nothing important.

So I decided to make this project to create some scripts and dashboard to know the status of my raspberrys and the system running on them.

1 - Check if the internet is up.
2 - Check if the machines listed in a file are responding to a ping.
3 - When the electricity from the concessionaire fails, manage the machines listed in item 2 to turn off before the UPS fails.
4 - Hardware with an attiny to control the power-on and power-off of the raspberry PI.
