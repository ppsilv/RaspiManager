# RaspiManager
Scripts to manage my raspberry PI.

As I have many raspberry PIs sometimes one of them are hold and I donÂ´t now until I try to connect to it, so I decided to put a led in all of them, and the script pisca.py (pisca = blink in my language), blinks the led so I know if it is running or not.
