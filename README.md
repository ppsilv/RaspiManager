# RaspiManager
Scripts to manage my raspberry PI.


pisca.py:

As I have many raspberry PIs sometimes one of them are hold and I donÂ´t now until I try to connect to it, so I decided to put a led in all of them, and the script pisca.py (pisca = blink in my language), blinks the led so I know if it is running or not.

ping.py

This script read a bunch of IPs from a file and ping every one logging the result.
Ping.py ping the local machines and log into maquinas_%Y%m%d.log, and also ping one site in internet to guarante the connection are ok and log into internet_%Y%m%d.log.
